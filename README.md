# FancyToys
A tool box like PowerToys, powered by UWP/.net5.

This version of FancyToys is too complicated to coordinates all part of project. After struggling for months I changed the framework from UWP-WinForm to WinUI3.
Mostly, this repo won't be updated.
By the way, [FancyToysArchived](https://github.com/MoeexT/FancyToysArchived) is the former version of this repo, its code sucks so I just dropped it and moved the useful code here.
But now, I gave it up again...
